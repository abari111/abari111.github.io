AI in general Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. It involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that would normally require human intervention. There are several subfields within AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision. AI can be divided into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a single task, and general or strong AI, which has the ability to perform multiple tasks and exhibit human-like intelligence The goal of AI research is to create machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing objects in images, and playing games. This field has seen rapid growth in recent years, and AI is now used in a variety of applications, including self-driving cars, virtual personal assistants, and financial trading systems. 2. Some definitions of Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Ameet Joshi, springer Alan Turing defined artificial intelligence as follows: \"If there is a machine behind a curtain and a human is interacting with it (by whatever means, e.g. audio or via typing etc.) and if the human feels like he/she is interacting with another human, then the machine is artifially intelligent.\" (Humanlike behavior) Refers as AI, machine that are capable of performing one or more of these tasks: understanding human language, performing mechanical tasks involving complex maneuvering, solving computer-based complex problems possibly involving large data in a very short time and reverting back answers in humanlike manner, etc. There are two aspects to AI as viewed from humanlike behavior standpoint. One is where the machine is intelligent and is capable of communication with humans, but does not have any locomotive aspects. The other aspect involves having physical interactions with humanlike locomotion capabilities, which refers to the field of robotics The Global politics of Artificial Intelligence: Maurizio Tinnirello All of the AI systems in place or under development today are what can be called \u201cnarrow artificial intelligence\u201d; basically, statistical models that can (teach themselves to) detect correlation, but not causality.

Activation functions are used to introduce nonlinearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex relationships in the data. There are many different types of activation functions that can be used in neural networks, including: Sigmoid: This is a smooth, s-shaped activation function that maps input values to a range of 0 to 1. It is often used in the output layer of binary classification models. Tanh: This is a smooth, symmetric activation function that maps input values to a range of -1 to 1. It is similar to the sigmoid function, but is centered at zero and has a wider output range. ReLU: This is a piecewise linear activation function that maps negative input values to zero and positive input values to the same value. It is fast to compute and has been widely used in deep learning models. Leaky ReLU: This is a variant of the ReLU activation function that allows negative input values to be mapped to a small negative value, rather than zero. It is used to address the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where some neurons in the network become inactive and stop learning. Softmax: This is an activation function that is used in the output layer of multi-class classification models. It maps input values to a probability distribution over the class labels.

The goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that can map the input data to the correct output, so that it can make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning include regression (predicting a continuous value) and classification (predicting a class label). Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the machine learning algorithm is not given any labeled data. Instead, it must discover patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering (grouping data into categories based on similarity) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the complexity of the data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space). Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, the machine learning algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. This type of learning is often used in autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars or robots. Multi-modal learning: In multi-modal learning, the machine learning algorithm uses multiple sources of information or data to learn about a particular subject or task. This can include using multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio, or using multiple sources of data, such as data from different sensors or devices. Transfer learning: Transfer learning involves using a machine learning model that has been trained on one task to perform a related task. This can be useful when there is limited data available for the target task, or when the target task is similar to the source task. Deep learning: Deep learning is a type of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks on large datasets. Deep learning models are often able to learn complex patterns and relationships in data, and have been successful in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition and natural language processing. Active learning: In active learning, the machine learning algorithm can interact with the environment or a human annotator to request labels or additional information, rather than relying solely on pre-labeled data. This can be useful in cases where labeling data is time-consuming or expensive, as it allows the algorithm to focus on the most important or uncertain examples. Semi-supervised learning: Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on a dataset that is partially labeled, with some examples having their correct output specified and others not. This can be useful when there is a large amount of data available, but only a small portion of it is labeled. Self-supervised learning: In self-supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm learns from input data that is automatically labeled, without the need for human annotation. For example, a self-supervised learning algorithm might be trained to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words, or to predict the missing words in a partially masked sentence. One-shot learning: One-shot learning involves training a machine learning model to perform a task using only a single example or a small number of examples. This can be useful in cases where obtaining additional examples is difficult or expensive. Few-shot learning: Few-shot learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model to perform a task using a small number of examples. This is similar to one-shot learning, but typically involves using a larger number of examples than one-shot learning. Few-shot learning is often used in cases where it is difficult to obtain a large dataset for training, or when the learning task requires a high degree of generalization. Zero-shot learning: Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model to perform a task without any examples of the task. Instead, the model is trained on a related task and then is expected to perform the target task based on its understanding of the underlying concepts. Zero-shot learning is often used when it is not possible to obtain any examples of the target task, or when the target task is very different from the training task. Lifelong learning: Lifelong learning is a type of machine learning in which a model continues to learn and adapt as it is exposed to new data and tasks over time. This can be useful in cases where the learning task is constantly changing or evolving, or when the model needs to adapt to new environments or situations. Online learning: Online learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on data that is streamed in real-time, rather than being pre-loaded into memory. This allows the model to learn and adapt as new data becomes available, and can be useful in cases where the data is too large to fit in memory or where the data is constantly changing. Batch learning: Batch learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on a fixed dataset, where all the data is pre-loaded into memory and the model is trained in one go. This is in contrast to online learning, where the model is trained on a continuous stream of data. Batch learning can be useful in cases where the data is relatively small and doesn't change over time, or when the model only needs to be trained once and then deployed without further updates. Incremental learning: Incremental learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on a dataset in small chunks or increments, rather than all at once. This can be useful in cases where the data is too large to fit in memory or where the model needs to learn and adapt to new data over time. Incremental learning is similar to online learning, but typically involves training on smaller batches of data at a time rather than a continuous stream of data. Curriculum learning: Curriculum learning is a type of machine learning that involves training a model on a sequence of increasingly complex tasks or datasets, rather than training on all the tasks at once. This can help the model learn more effectively and efficiently by building on its previous knowledge and skills. Ensemble learning: Ensemble learning is a type of machine learning that involves training multiple models and then combining their predictions to make a final decision. This can be done by averaging the predictions of the models, or by training a separate model to combine the predictions of the individual models. Ensemble learning can often improve the accuracy and robustness of the final model by leveraging the strengths of multiple models. Machine learning techniques can be applied to a wide variety of tasks, including predictive modeling, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, and more.

It consists of a collection of input/output pairs that the model uses to learn the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. The model's parameters are adjusted during training in order to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the true labels in the training set. Validation set: The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training.

The validation set provides an estimate of the model's generalization ability, but it is not used to update the model's parameters. Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the model's final performance. It is held out from the training process and is only used to evaluate the model after training is complete. The test set provides an independent estimate of the model's generalization ability, and is used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

Each of these subsets serves a different purpose: Training set: The training set is used to train the model. It consists of a collection of input/output pairs that the model uses to learn the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. The model's parameters are adjusted during training in order to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the true labels in the training set. Validation set: The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. It is typically used to tune the model's hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the regularization strength. The validation set provides an estimate of the model's generalization ability, but it is not used to update the model's parameters. Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the model's final performance. It is held out from the training process and is only used to evaluate the model after training is complete. The test set provides an independent estimate of the model's generalization ability, and is used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

There are several steps involved in training a model, including: Preparing the data: This involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, such as handling missing values, normalizing numerical data, and encoding categorical data. It may also involve splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. Defining the model: This involves selecting the appropriate model architecture and loss function for the task at hand. The model architecture defines the structure and organization of the model, such as the number of layers and the number of units in each layer. The loss function measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels, and is used to guide the optimization process. Choosing an optimization algorithm: This involves selecting an optimization algorithm that will be used to adjust the model's parameters in order to minimize the loss function. There are many different optimization algorithms available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Training the model: This involves feeding the data into the model and using the optimization algorithm to adjust the model's parameters in order to minimize the loss function. This process is typically repeated for multiple epochs, where an epoch is a complete pass through the training data. Evaluating the model: After training, it is important to evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset in order to get an estimate of the model's generalization ability. This can be done by calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. These are the general steps involved in training a machine learning model. The specific details of the process will depend on the characteristics of the data, the task being performed, and the chosen model and optimization algorithm.","title":"Training a deep learning"},{"location":"DL/training/#training-model","text":"Training a machine learning model involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the true labels in the training data.

Here are some common problems that can arise when working with deep learning models: Overfitting: This occurs when a model is too complex for the amount of data it is being trained on, and it ends up learning patterns in the training data that do not generalize to new, unseen data. This can lead to poor performance on test data or in real-world applications. Underfitting: This occurs when a model is not complex enough to capture the patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and test data. Vanishing gradients: This can occur in deep neural networks with many layers, where the gradients of the weights with respect to the loss function become very small. This can make it difficult for the optimizer to update the weights and can lead to slow or stalled training. Exploding gradients: This is the opposite of vanishing gradients and occurs when the gradients become very large, leading to unstable and erratic training. Poor convergence: This occurs when the model is unable to find a good set of weights that minimize the loss function. This can be due to a poorly designed model, poor choice of hyperparameters, or other factors. Inefficient training: Deep learning models can require a lot of computational resources and time to train, and it can be challenging to find ways to train them efficiently. These are just a few examples of the many problems that can arise when working with deep learning models. However, there are often ways to address these problems, such as using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, using more appropriate model architectures, and carefully tuning hyperparameters.","title":"Avoid recurrent training problems"},{"location":"DL/training_pb/#training-problems","text":"Deep learning models, like all machine learning models, can face a variety of challenges and difficulties during training and inference.

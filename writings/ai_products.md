## **Key Patterns Across 70 Years**

1. **User Evolution**: From researchers → specialists → early adopters → mainstream consumers
2. **Interface Evolution**: Command line → graphical → voice → conversational text → multi-modal (text, images, voice)
3. **Adoption Catalysts**: Beating humans at complex tasks consistently drives mainstream attention
4. **Success Factors**: Solving real problems, intuitive interfaces, and clear value propositions
5. **Failure Points**: Over-promising capabilities, limited real-world applicability, user trust issues

The most successful AI products solved specific problems users couldn't solve otherwise, provided intuitive interfaces, and delivered consistent value. Products that merely demonstrated AI capabilities without solving real problems typically remained in research settings.

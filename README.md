## About Me

I am Abari DODO, a junior engineer specialized in embedded systems and artificial intelligence. I hold a degree in embedded systems from the National School of Applied Sciences of Fez, Morocco, and a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in France. My focus lies in the intersection of embedded systems and artificial intelligence, with a particular interest in designing AI models that can be executed at the edge (on devices). I am also fascinated by the broader applications of AI. Through my internship experiences, I have gained valuable insights into AI research and programming embedded systems. Here are some of the domains that capture my interest.
